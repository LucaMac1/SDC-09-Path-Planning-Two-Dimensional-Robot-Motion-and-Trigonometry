# SDC-09-Path-Planning-Two-Dimensional-Robot-Motion-and-Trigonometry

In a real scenario, you would need to use an accelerometer, a rate gyroscope, and an odometer to reconstruct the actual XY trajectory of the vehicle.

In the Kalman filter section, you have learnt how to convert acceleration data into displacement data, and how to use the gyroscope to calculate the direction.

However, when you know that a vehicle is heading in a certain direction and know its moving distance, how to calculate its accurate moving distance in the X and Y directions?

This chapter aims to determine the position change in X and Y directions according to the direction and displacement of the vehicle itself.
